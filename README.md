Jig
===

Jig is intended to be a library of preset animations/behaviors utilizing Greensocks powerful TweenLite and TimelineLite.
I started Jig so I could become more familiar with developing javascript components and the Greensock Animation Platform. 

While JQuery can do much of what Jig will be able to do, Jig's scope is smaller and it's target audience is predominatley  web animators/motion designers.
