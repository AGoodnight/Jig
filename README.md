Jig
===

Jig is intended to make it easier to manage/implement libraries of preset animations/behaviors utilizing Greensocks powerful TweenLite and TimelineLite.

I started Jig so I could become more familiar with developing javascript components and the Greensock Animation Platform. 

While JQuery can do much of what Jig will be able to do, Jig's scope is smaller and it's target audience is predominatley  web animators & motion designers, individuals who may or may not know the any javascript. Greensock's Animation Platform is also much faster and less processor intensive than JQuery's animation features, making it the ideal foundation for an engineered system.
